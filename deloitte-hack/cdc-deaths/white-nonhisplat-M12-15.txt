Caveats:
"1. As of April 3, 2017, the underlying cause of death has been revised for 125 deaths in 2014. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#2014-Revision."
"2. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Unreliable."
"3. The populations used to calculate standard age-adjusted rates are documented here: More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#2000 Standard Population."
"4. The method used to calculate age-adjusted rates is documented here: More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Age-Adjusted Rates."
"5. Deaths for persons of unknown age are included in counts and crude rates, but are not included in age-adjusted rates."
"6. Deaths of persons with Hispanic origin ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among"
"Hispanic Origin groups, so are not included in the Hispanic Origin specific counts and rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Not Stated."
"7. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the"
"funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis"
"of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin"
"are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Racial Differences."
"8. The method used to calculate 95% confidence intervals is documented here: More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Confidence-Intervals."
"9. The population figures for year 2015 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2015"
"postcensal series released by NCHS on June 28, 2016. The population figures for year 2014 are bridged-race estimates of the July"
"1 resident population, from the Vintage 2014 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 30, 2015. The population figures for"
"year 2013 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2013 postcensal series released by NCHS"
"on June 26, 2014. The population figures for year 2012 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the"
"Vintage 2012 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 13, 2013. The population figures for year 2011 are bridged-race"
"estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2011 postcensal series released by NCHS on July 18, 2012."
"Population figures for 2010 are April 1 Census counts. The population figures for years 2001 - 2009 are bridged-race estimates"
"of the July 1 resident population, from the revised intercensal county-level 2000 - 2009 series released by NCHS on October 26,"
"2012. Population figures for 2000 are April 1 Census counts. Population figures for 1999 are from the 1990-1999 intercensal"
"series of July 1 estimates. Population figures for the infant age groups are the number of live births. <br/><b>Note:</b> Rates"
"and population figures for years 2001 - 2009 differ slightly from previously published reports, due to use of the population"
"estimates which were available at the time of release."
"10. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the"
"resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Age Group."
"11. Changes to cause of death classification affect reporting trends. More information:"
